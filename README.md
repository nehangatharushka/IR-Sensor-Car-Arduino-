# IR-Sensor-Car-Arduino-

Develop using 3 IR sensor / Motor Controller / Arduino Board / batteries / car chassis / arduino UNO / car running video clip included

Introduction

• Nitro is a line following robot that can detect the black line on the white surface and move along that predefined path or the line.
• Nitro has two sensors install underneath the front part of the body , and two geared motors drive wheel forward and it has ultrasonic sensor to detect an object when object is detect to that sensor Nitro will stop and generate beep sound through Buzzer
• This robot also have the capability to navigate junctions and decide on which junction to turn and which junction ignore
